    <p>The rich flavour of the rice comes from the grains that have been pre-fried in chicken fat and then cooked in chicken broth.
       The chicken is poached until it is just cooked, with a little pink remaining on the flesh near the bones.
       While the cut chicken is presented on a large dish, the rice is served on individual plates. 
       The dish is accompanied with a chilli sauce made of chillies, chicken broth, garlic and ginger. 
       A thick broth of chicken stock, garnished with a sprinkle of spring onions and coriander leaves, is also a must
       An early version of the dish featured rice compacted into balls. The rice balls were made of shorter-grained rice, and cooked with pandan leaves and ginger slices over a controlled fire.
       The rice is then shaped into balls with bare hands before it goes cold.
       This version of the dish is seldom seen in Singapore now.</p>
